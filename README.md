# RAD-Core
This is my final year engineering project.
The topic of the project is to set priority and affinity for threads and processes in multi-platform environments.
The project contains two parts: 
1. The core which is a library that can be imported into the IDE. The library performs the affinity and priority operations 
on operating system level. 
2. An engine which uses the core and can be executed independently to set priorities/affinities.
